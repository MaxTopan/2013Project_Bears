# 2013Project_Bears

This is the first Unity project I attempted, back in 2013/4.

Since then I have come a very long way in terms of understanding of object oriented programming, and good programming practice in general.

The conversion to Unity 5 has broken the animations, and the custom level editor.

Regardless I am leaving the project as it was, aside from minor edits to make the main levels playable.
